# message-board-frontend
The frontend component of the message board I'm building! Built using React, ReactDOM, React Router, and many other packages. 
All packages can be found in the package.json.

This is currently not anywhere close to done. It is in the pre-Alpha stage of development, and since I'm only one person and I can only work on it so much, please have patience in having new features be added. 

Changelog: 
For now, a changelog exists on LandingPage.js, so when you launch the server you should be able to see a changelog of what I've been working on recently. 

If you find any bugs in this software, please open an issue ticket on the github: https://github.com/gclancy121/message-board-frontend

REQUIRED FOR THIS TO RUN PROPERLY:
For now, you *must* download the API I created specifically for this application. It can be found here: https://github.com/gclancy121/message-board-api

HOW TO START: 

Go to the terminal, and simply type "npm start". The app should start without issue.
