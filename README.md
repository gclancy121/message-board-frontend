# message-board-frontend
The frontend component of the message board I'm building! Built using React, ReactDOM, React Router, and many other packages. 
All packages can be found in the package.json.

This is currently not anywhere close to done, *especially* in the styling. I'm focusing on the functionality over the look for now, but I will make this no longer look like it came from 1998.

If you find any bugs in this software, please open an issue ticket on the github: https://github.com/gclancy121/message-board-frontend

REQUIRED FOR THIS TO RUN PROPERLY:
For now, you *must* download the API I created specifically for this application. It can be found here: https://github.com/gclancy121/message-board-api

HOW TO START: 

Go to the terminal, and simply type "npm start". The app should start without issue.
